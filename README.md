# Managing bookings and access for any specified service via telegram
Telegram Bot for any service requiring booking's and user authentication on arrival. Currently I have modified the code to work for a tattoo-shop
as a example.

- **Maximum Booking Horizon:** 46 hours in advance.
- **Minimum Booking Horizon:** 0 hours in advance.
- **Standard Booking Slot** 2 hour long window

**This approach is fully automatic, meaning:**
- When a time slot expires (i.e., its `end_time` is earlier than the current time), it is removed from the `time_slots` table, ensuring it is not displayed to users.
- The population of time slots occurs every hour, ensuring that new time slots are continuously generated, maintaining availability for booking up to 46 hours in advance.

## Features:

### Getting API Key from BotFather

To use the Telegram Bot API, you need to obtain an API key from BotFather. Follow these steps to get your API key:

## Steps to Get Your API Key

1. **Start a Chat with BotFather**
   - Open Telegram and search for [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
   - Start a chat with BotFather by clicking "Start" or typing `/start`.

2. **Create a New Bot**
   - Type the command `/newbot` and send it.
   - BotFather will ask you to provide a name for your bot. Enter a name (e.g., "MyBot").
   - Next, provide a username for your bot. This username must end in `bot` (e.g., "my_bot").

3. **Receive Your API Key**
   - Once you've provided the name and username, BotFather will create your bot and give you an API key.
   - The API key will be in the format: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrSTUVwxyZ`.
   - Copy this API key as you'll need it to configure your bot.

4. **Save the API Key**
   - Keep your API key secure and do not share it with others.
   - Use this API key to authenticate requests to the Telegram Bot API.
  
5. **Place the API Key within config/settings.py file**
   - Open the following above mentioned file within you're project directory structure.
   - Then paste you're key in the placement of 'telegram_bot_token' variable value

   This is the 'settings.py' file:
   ```
   import os

   # Database PostgreSQL Credentials
   postgresql_db_name = os.getenv("postgresql_db_name","example_database_name")
   postgresql_db_passwd = os.getenv("postgresql_db_passwd", "example_password")
   postgresql_db_usr = os.getenv("postgresql_db_usr", "example_database_user")
   postgresql_port = os.getenv("postgresql_port", "5432")      # Default port// Change if wanted
   postgresql_host = os.getenv("postgresql_host", "localhost")      # Locally hosted db// Change if wanted
   
   # Telegram Bot API TOKEN:       [unique token to identify the bot and communicate with it.]
   telegram_bot_token = os.getenv("telegram_bot_token", "PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")
   
   # Images to send to users within chat:
   start_menu_image_voucher_applied_logo = os.getenv("start_menu_image_logo", "./images/start_menu_image_logo.png")

   # Admin manage time-slot bookings dashboard access password string:
   admin_manage_bookings_dashboard_password = os.getenv("admin_manage_bookings_dashboard_password", "/<youre_complex_password_here>")
   ```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>



## Works out of the box üì¶

This project is configured to work out of the box with default settings. However, you'll need to customize several configuration files to tailor the application to your needs. Follow the instructions below to modify database credentials, images, FAQ content, and more.

## Configuration

### 1. Update Configuration Settings

You need to modify the `./config/settings.py` file to include your own database credentials, Telegram Bot API token, and other configurations.

####  `./config/settings.py`:

```python
import os

# Database PostgreSQL Credentials
postgresql_db_name = os.getenv("postgresql_db_name", "your_db_name")
postgresql_db_passwd = os.getenv("postgresql_db_passwd", "your_db_password")
postgresql_db_usr = os.getenv("postgresql_db_usr", "your_db_user")
postgresql_port = os.getenv("postgresql_port", "5432")      # Default port // Change if needed
postgresql_host = os.getenv("postgresql_host", "localhost")  # Locally hosted db // Change if needed

# Telegram Bot API TOKEN
telegram_bot_token = os.getenv("telegram_bot_token", "your_bot_token")

# Images to send to users within chat:
start_menu_image_logo = os.getenv("start_menu_image_logo", "./images/start_menu_image_logo.png")
how_is_our_tattoo_made_video = os.getenv("how_is_our_tattoo_made_video", "./videos/how_is_our_tattoo_made.mp4")

# Admin manage time-slot bookings dashboard access password string:
admin_manage_bookings_dashboard_password = os.getenv("admin_manage_bookings_dashboard_password", "your_dashboard_password")
```

<br>
<br>

### 2. Update FAQ Data

Modify the FAQ data and answers in `./config/faq_data.py` and `./config/faq_answers.py` respectively.
Make sure when modifying that the variable holding the value matches in 'faq_data' and 'faq_answers'. For e.g; 'faq_opening_hours' and 'faq_opening_hours'. 
You can change the variable and the value, just make sure they match. As the logic matches both variables to find data to display and awnser corresponding question. 
You can also add more FAQ questions and awnsers only be modifying these files. 

#### `./config/faq_data.py`:

```python
from utils.logger import setup_logger
logger = setup_logger(service_name="faq_data")

# Frequently asked questions
faq_data = {
    "faq_years_of_experience": "How many years of experience?",
    "faq_opening_hours": "Opening hours?",
    "faq_accepted_payment_options": "What payment methods are accepted?",
    "faq_contact_info": "Contact Info?",
    "how_is_our_tattoo_made": "How is your tattoo made?",
}
```

```

## Database Schema
The database schema used within this application and the internal logic of how we utilise it is very important. I will explain the logic
of the table's and there purpose. The databaase is managed by a few service_python function. The integration and usage of the database 
is optimized for robust logic.

### Interacting with the Database Asynchronously Without Blocking

#### How `DependencyContainer` and `initialize_connection_pool` Work Together

In `main.py`, the `initialize_connection_pool()` function and the `DependencyContainer` class are used together to manage database connections efficiently. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of their interaction:

Code snippet from within the 'main.py' file:
```
# Initialize the connection pool
  pool = await initialize_connection_pool()
  # Set the pool in the dependency container, only done once.
  container.set_pool(pool)
```

Code snippet from within the 'test_pool_object_from_user_handler.py' file:
```
from dependencies import container
from services_python.return_cursor_connection_to_pool import return_cursor_connection_to_pool
```

```
async def test_pool_object_from_user_handler(callback):
    # Here we get the pool connection
    pool = container.get_pool()
    if pool:
        try:
            logger.info(f"{Colors.CYAN}Performing database operations...{Colors.END}")

            # Acquire a connection from the pool
            async with pool.acquire() as connection:
                logger.info(f'Acquired a connection from the pool')
                # Acquire a cursor from the connection
                async with connection.cursor() as cursor:
                    # Perform any database operations here
                    logger.info(f'Acquired a cursor and attempting query')

                    await cursor.execute("SELECT version();")
                    result = await cursor.fetchone()
                    logger.info(f"{Colors.GREEN}Database version:{Colors.END} {result}")

                    # Now send a message to the user:
                    await callback.message.answer(f"The current database version: {result}")


                    # Return the cursor and connection to the pool
                    await return_cursor_connection_to_pool(cursor)
                    logger.info(f"Successfully returned the cursor and connection to the pool!")
```         

- **Connection Pool Initialization**:
  - The `initialize_connection_pool()` function sets up a pool of database connections to PostgreSQL, enabling efficient management of concurrent database operations.
  - This function returns a `pool` object, which includes connection details such as database name, user, password, host, and port. This pool object is then used to acquire connections and cursors for           database interactions.

- **Setting the Connection Pool**:
  - Once the connection pool is created, it needs to be accessible throughout the application. The `DependencyContainer` class facilitates this by storing and managing the connection pool.
  - The `DependencyContainer` class, imported from `dependencies.py`, provides methods to set (`set_pool()`) and get (`get_pool()`) the pool.
  - The `pool` object is stored in the `DependencyContainer` using `container.set_pool(pool)`, allowing it to be accessed from different parts of the application.

- **Integration**:
  - In `main.py`, after `initialize_connection_pool()` creates the connection pool, it is set in the `DependencyContainer` using the `container.set_pool(pool)` method.
  - The `DependencyContainer` instance (`container`) stores the pool, enabling various parts of the application to access it via `container.get_pool()`.

- **Usage**:
  - The connection pool stored in `DependencyContainer` can be accessed throughout the application, facilitating efficient database operations without the need to create new connections for each request.

#### Imports Used
- To interact with the database and manage the connection pool, the following imports are used:
    - `from services_python.return_cursor_connection_to_pool import return_cursor_connection_to_pool`
    - `from dependencies import container`

### Understanding usage of tables
#### 'time_slots' table:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each time slot.
    - **Purpose**:
        Identifying if a time_slot row within table. So we can
        extract all data from it.
        
- `start_time`: The start time of the time slot.
- `end_time`: The end time of the time slot.
    - **Purpose**:
        Identifying the start_time and end_time of the booking, so we can correctly
        authenitcate a client if within booking time when authenticating booking.

- `is_booked`: A boolean flag indicating whether the slot is booked.
    - **Purpose**:
        Identifying if a time_slot within table is currently booked. So we can
        authenitcate a client if within booking time when authenticating booking.
        
        And also display the available time-slots which are not booked to a user
        for future booking.

<br>
<br>

#### **Functions utilising  'time_slots' table**:
  - These are all the functions interacting with the time_slots table in one way or another.
    - **`services_python/` Directory**: Manages backend services and database interactions. This includes:
      - **`check_user_access_by_access_pin.py`**: Checks user access based on the provided access pin.
      - **`fetch_all_available_time_slots.py`**: Fetches all available time slots.
      - **`fetch_all_time_slots.py`**: Fetches all time slots.
      - **`fetch_time_slot_row_by_id.py`**: Fetches a time slot row by its ID.
      - **`manage_booking_time_slots.py`**: Manages booking for time slots.
      - **`pupulate_time_slots.py`**: Populates time slots.

    query_insert = """
        INSERT INTO time_slots (start_time, end_time, is_booked) 
        SELECT %s, %s, FALSE
        WHERE NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM time_slots
            WHERE start_time = %s AND end_time = %s
        )
    """
    Variables holding values: time_slots_to_insert, start, end
    for start, end in time_slots_to_insert:
        await cursor.execute(query_insert, (start, end, start, end))
    ```
   - **Purpose**: Inserts new time slots for the next 46 hours if they do not already exist, with `is_booked` set to `FALSE`.
   - **SQL Query**: Inserts time slots where they do not already exist in the table.

#### 'pins' table:
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for each pins enterting process.
    - **Purpose**:
        Corresponding pin enter to user-id of telegram. So we can
        map the 5 digit PIN being entered by user trough key-pad GUI to the user while entering.

        Using this datbase approach allows multiple users to enter a using multiple pin key-presses.
        
- `pin`: The 5 digit PIN entered by the user using key-pad.
    - **Purpose**:
        Saving the entered pin digits within datbase, so we can correctly
        authenitcate a client entered PIN corresponding to actuall existing auth-pin's within 'time_slots' table.

        Basically we need database approach to view what PIN sequence client entered using auth dashboard.
        Then we store the PIN within table untill reaches 5 digits. After entering all 5 we do the auth process.
        After auth process PIN is imidiatly deleted from DB. So user can auth again.
