# Main ToDo's Today:

1,
-Make it so database populating function is automatically ran from main.py every
2H, async ofcours.

2,
-Document the entire logic of the dashboard booking GUI, and the logic behind it.
, also how it is managed.
+ Also document how to verify manually you're time-slot booking is working as expected.

3,
-Then create function to actually manage the database time-slots making
them unavailable, aka BOOKED.

4,
-Then create a management command, string '/ta6fsugsfta8sgf' to access the confirm
order time-slot/confirm booking dasboar for the admin user, mangement for bookings.
