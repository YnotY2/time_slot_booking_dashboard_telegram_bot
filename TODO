# Main ToDo's Today:

1,
-Make it so database populating function is automatically ran from main.py every
2H, async ofcours. DONE


2,
-Then create function to actually manage the database time-slots making
them unavailable, aka BOOKED. DONE

3,
-Then create a management command, string '/ta6fsugsfta8sgf' to access the confirm
order time-slot/confirm booking dasboar for the admin user, mangement for bookings.
DONE

4,
Allow the admin to set 'is_booked' = True for any AVAILABLE time-slots,
(can make a time-slot available or unavailable. Mostly unavailable tho. [main purpose])
DONE

5, Modify managing bookings function, to return a 5 int PIN when 'is_booked' is set to TRUE.
if a time-slot 'is_booked' is set to FALSE, we remove the PIN.

The PIN should be added within the table 'time_slots' making it a check for when
user-attempts to access service.
